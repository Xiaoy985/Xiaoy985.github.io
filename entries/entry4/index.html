	<h1><span class="faerie">For people who are hesitating about getting a puppy</h1></span> 
	<p>
		During the week I picked a puppy from the breeder with my roommate and it was a <a class="link" href="https://www.dailypaws.com/dogs-puppies/dog-breeds/cavapoo">Cavapoo</a>, a mixed breed dog--a cross between the 
	</p>
	<img src="imgs/dog1.png"><img src="imgs/plus.png"><img src="imgs/dog2.png">
	<p>
	<span class="dog1">Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</span> and <span class="dog2">Poodle dog breeds.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		When choosing among a group of dogs, we saw him at first sight, maybe this is fate! With big round eyes staring straight at us, I was instantly captured by his cute expression and decided it was<span class="him">him</span>!
	</p>
	<img class="rotatepicture"src="imgs/pupu.jpeg"width="200" height="200">

	<p>We named him<span class="fillrect">Pupu</span>, which in our language means to throw into one's arms. He was only two months old, with curly brown and white fur, and he was warm to hold.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we took him home we realized the problems we were about to face:
	</p>
<ol class="list">
<li> Clean up the piss and shit all over the floor</li>
<li>Take him out for a walk every day</li>
<li>Take regular baths</li>
<li>Spend time playing with him</li>
<li>Clean up the pads</li>
<li>Woke up by his "morning calls"</li>
<li>Take it to the hospital when sick</li>
<li><span class="alternate">To be explored...</span></li>
</ol>
	
<p>But at the same time you also get a puppy that:
<ul class="list2">
    <li>Always follow you</li>
    <li class="picture">Love to sleep at your feet</li>
    <li>Watching TV with you</li>
    <li>Always wagging his tail at you</li>
    <li>Never refuse your hug</li>
    <li>Even if you yell at him it will still love you</li>
    <li class="picture2">Winks to you</li>
    <li>Always with you</li>
    <li>Can guard the door</li>
    <li>Protecting you</li>
    <li>...</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>For us, there may be many people who can accompany, but the dog only has us. We do not unilaterally own the dog, but accompany each other. 
</p>
<p class="highlight">So if you decide to own a puppy, <a class="cursor">think carefully ! ! !</a>
</p>
<p>
As newbies, we are still figuring out the most comfortable way to get along with Pupu.
</p>
<p class="gradient-fill">Our journey with Pupu has just begun, please let us go together in the future!!</p>
