  <p class="text1">
 	I started learning guitar in junior high school and had one lesson a week, after two years of learning I did not take lessons from the teacher but taught myself
 </p>
 <p class="text2">
 But my first contact was with classical guitar, and later with folk guitar. They are both very similar in their playing techniques except for the tone.
</p>
<p class="text3">
And the electric guitar was something I only bought when I came to New York, and I didn't know anything about it before that.
</p>
 <p class="text4">If the electric guitar is not connected to the electric box it can only make a small sound itself.
